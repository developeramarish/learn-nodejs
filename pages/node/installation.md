### Linux

We can easily install Node.js on linux/ubuntu/centOS/fedora/linuxmint etc. To install Node.js on Linux (Ubuntu) operating system, follow these instructions:

1. Open Ubuntu Terminal (You can use shortcut keys (Ctrl+Alt+T)
2. Type command `sudo apt-get install python-software-properties`

4. Type the password and press Enter
5. Type command `sudo apt-add-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js` and press Enter twice
6. Type command `sudo apt-get update` ( Wait for sometime or go for a coffee)

### Mac

You can download the latest version of Node.js installable archive file from [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/) and follow the installation steps by clicking Next in each screen.

But the easiest way of install Node.js in Mac is using [Brew](https://brew.sh)

If you don't have brew installed, you can install it with the following command line 

`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

then run `brew update && brew doctor`

Next, add Homebrew's location to your `$PATH` in your `.bash_profile` or .`zshrc` file.

`export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH`

Next, install Node (npm will be installed with Node):

`brew install node`

## Checks

When the installation is completed you can check the version of Node.js by running `node --version`

And check the version of npm by running `npm -v`
